## This Site

In a world where the lines between the physical and digital dimensions blur with each passing day, having a thoughtful online presence is no longer an option—it's a necessity. Put simply, my inspiriation for making this site was drawn more from an attitude of practicality than pure creative ambition. I find a lot of inspiration in my work, and luckily it rarely involves self-promotion. But regardless of my intent, or your motivation for visiting, thanks for checking out my site. I'm Jared, and this is where I share some of my thoughts, projects, and experiences as a web developer.

## About Me

While my professional life revolves around code, my personal life is grounded in North Texas with my wife, two kids, and a garden that demands attention. My journey into web development began with my dad, a software engineer whose passion for technology sparked my own. Since helping him implement LAMP stack solutions in 2010, I've been hooked on this ever-evolving field.

## My Job

As a web developer, I work at the intersection of human needs and technical possibilities. The best technology often goes unnoticed—it just works. This belief guides my approach to creating intuitive, frictionless digital experiences."

## My Design Philosophy

My philosophy is simple: great technology feels invisible. Light switches, steering wheels, a comfortable pair of shoes - all become nearly unnoticable when designed well. Even a coffee maker that starts brewing at the right time each morning fades into the background of your routine. Following this principle, I create digital spaces that feel natural and intuitive, reducing friction between users and their goals.

## What's Ahead

I've recently started a freelance web development business focused on e-commerce and modern web applications. If you're looking to build or improve your online presence, let's talk about creating something that works seamlessly for your users. I'd be absolutely thrilled to help you bring your vision to life.
