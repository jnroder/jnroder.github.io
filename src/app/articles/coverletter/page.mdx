## The Hunt

I'm currently unemployed and actively applying for jobs (I know, an undesirable state and gauche admission, but there it is). This morning, I decided, for purely analytical and non-self-pitying reasons, to search my email for application submission confirmations. The result of my expert analysis showed that I'm at a grand total of 160 jobs applied for, now. Nice! About to start closing in on that coveted 200 applications sent milestone. Feels gooood...

Oh wait, no it doesn't. It's a different feeling. What is it? Oh yes, "bad." It feels bad. Now, usually, I'm not one to complain. I wouldn't say I'm overly-positive, either, but I think the fact that I've been able to submit 1.25 applications a day (including weekends) for the past 4 months indicates that I have at least some level of tenacity and head-keeping-up-ed-ness. I mean, it's a rough one out there right now; a lot of people are struggling. And if I *really* want to contribute and be a part of the solution I have to differentiate myself and demonstrate my value.

So today I tried to be different.

## The Application

I applied to a position today, and not just a throwaway or long-shot position, either. It was a position that I was genuinely excited about. I read the job description and thought, "I could do that. I could do that *well*." So I applied. And, as I sometimes do, I wrote a cover letter.

Usually the cover letters that I write are pretty formulaic:
> "I'm applying for [position] at [company]. I think I'd be a great fit because [reasons that match job description]. etc..."

Less frequently, when there's a job I'm especially interested in, I get a little more personal and free-form with my writing... you know, to try to let them see my personality and enthusiasm for the work!

And as I was feeling particularly *inspired* today, I came up with this little gem. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to share it, but I'm going to anyway. I think it's a good idea to be honest and transparent about the job search process, and I think this letter is a good example of that. So here it is:

## The Letter

> Hey there!
> 
> First off, business: I meet ALL of the qualification requirements of this job, EXCEPT for one: [REDACTED]. But as it happens I've been working on a personal project where I've been doing just that. I won't bore you with the details. It's not live yet, but you can check out the repo here: https://github.com/jnroder/wealth-inequality. Don't read too much into the subtext, I swear I'm not a communist... ;) shhh...
> Beyond meeting listed qualifications, I know I could do the job well because it's what I do and have done for over a decade... because it's right in my f\*\*\*ing wheelhouse, man. I kick ass at this sh\*\*! Yeah, I said it. So what??
> 
> Now that that's out of the way, I'll tell you more about me. Yes... Well, to be frank, I'm broke and I'm discouraged. I haven't been able to land a job since I got laid off in September. I need some income soon (like VERY soon) or I'm afraid I'm going to have to sell my house. No cap! And it's unlikely that we (my wife and I) could afford another. We just bought this one a little over a year ago, after 5 years of saving up (on dual incomes), and haven't built up enough equity to matter much. I guess the American Dream costs a little more than it used to. *Sigh...* It's just not like it was in the old days, when you could always get some extra dough by doing some muscle work for the Union boss or by sending your kids to the local factory to feed coal into the scalding furnaces of progress and oil the untiring machines of industry. No, instead I must "rise and grind" to feed my "10x mindset" that I use to "drive actionable outcomes" and "streamline efficiency metrics." All while meticulously monitoring my consumer choices and caloric intake, aaand remembering to hit the the gym at least once a day. Eat your heart out Patrick Bateman.
> 
> I could have attempted, here, to \*Be Positive!\*, and write a bright and bubbly blurb about my love for technology and my passion for the industry, like I have many, many times before, but it's hard to sustain that feeling after a while and I'm getting tired of feeling like a fraud. I have reached my limit of BS generation... at least for the day. And as it turns out, it feels much better to come right out and say what I'm really thinking. Go figure.
> 
> Well, that's it. I hope you enjoyed reading this. I'm really not crazy, just wanted to try something new.
> I really do think I would be a good fit for this position :).
> 
> Sincerely,
> Jared
> 
> P.S.
> Always remember to "give 110 percent." It's the only way to "move the needle."

## The Lesson

From a purely pragmatic point of view, I doubt this letter will land me the job. But writing it made me feel better, and for once, I was proud of what I’d said—that’s got to count for something.
Maybe the lesson here is that honesty and transparency in the job search can be worthwhile (unlikely). More realistically, it’s that venting your frustrations in a creative way can be therapeutic. Either way, I’m glad I found a way to make the hunt a little more bearable today.
